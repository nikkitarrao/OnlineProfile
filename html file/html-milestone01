       Programming Skills
    </h2>
        <p>I have a moderate level of experienve in Java. I am newer to the computer science program since I had only semi-recently transferred majors. So far I have only taken computer programming fundamentals I and II where I learned to code in Java. </p>

       General Interests
    </h2>
        <p>I have always been interested in the arts and creating art since I was young. I mainly enjoy painting with oil paints and keeping a stetchbook. I hope to learn how to create art digitally in the future. I am also interested in volleyball, as I used to play for both my highschool team as well as the NYC Parks club team. I haven't played in a while, so I am a bit rusty, but recently I started to play during recreation hours here at St John's for fun. I also recently have wanted to learn how to skateboard. I don't have the best balance, and I am only a beginner, but one day I hope to ride nice and smooth (and maybe learn some tricks).  </p>
